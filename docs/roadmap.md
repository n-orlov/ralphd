# Roadmap

Versions are milestones, not promises of dates. Each version is releasable on its
own; scope may shift between minors, not the ordering of the big rocks.

> **Status (v0.6 close-out):** v0.1 through v0.6's engine/CLI/hub-UI feature
> scope is implemented and covered by black-box tests, including a real
> docker-sibling e2e tier and a real browser e2e tier for the hub — see
> `artifacts/reports/traceability.md` (v0.1–v0.4 requirements),
> `artifacts/reports/issue-traceability.md` (backlog issues → requirement
> letter → task → commit → tests: v0.5's #1–#11/#13, plus v0.6's #14–#22 as
> requirement I lands them) and
> `artifacts/reports/v0.5-definition-of-done.md` (evidence per DoD bullet).
> The job image now **builds** locally, content-hash-tagged, from a checkout or
> a `pipx`-style install (v0.6, requirement H). What remains outside the
> scope of every version so far: *publishing* that image to a registry and the
> wheel to an index — see the deferred list.

## v0.1 — the working loop (MVP)

The smallest thing that is genuinely useful and proves every load-bearing design
decision:

- ✅ Engine: planning → worker → review loop, approaches + composite PRD, sentinels,
  atomic `tasks.json`, iteration records, `events.jsonl`
- ✅ Vigilant mode and model strategies (they are cheap once per-phase model resolution
  exists, and were designed in from the start)
- Container API: ✅ status/tasks/iterations/events/steering/interrupt/abort/shutdown
  + bearer token; ✅ `GET /logs` whole-job stream (incl. `follow`), prompts/skills/
  creds/llm runtime CRUD
- `ralphctl`: ✅ `start`, `runs`, `status`, `watch`, `tasks`, `steer`, `interrupt`,
  `pause/unpause`, `abort`, `stop`, `rm`, `artifacts`, `doctor`, `resume`
  (fresh container over an existing run dir); ✅ pretty `logs`
  (tail-style, whole-job console), `skills`, `creds`, `prompts`, `llm`, `config`
- ✅ Credentials: env-file convention (`--creds <dir>` of `<name>.env` files →
  `~/.creds/` in-container; prompts advertise the inventory; agent sources on
  demand) — the file-based analogue of original Ralph's AWS Secrets approach
- ✅ LLM profiles: format + `host`/`none` built-ins + bedrock and gateway example
  profiles **with acceptance tests proving both**
- ⏳ Docker image published (amd64/arm64); `pipx install ralphd` from an index —
  the image is built and run locally by `start`/`resume` themselves (v0.6
  requirement H, proven by the docker-sibling e2e tier and the real-build
  tier) but has never been pushed to a registry, and the package has never
  been published to PyPI; publishing is not attempted (no CI/publishing
  pipeline exists in this environment) and is deferred explicitly below
- Docs: the design docs kept in sync with reality (ongoing) + a tutorial ✅
  (`docs/tutorial.md`)

Non-goals for v0.1: resume, web UI, self-reflection, multi-job orchestration.

## v0.2 — durability & recovery

- ✅ `ralphctl resume <run-id>`: fresh container over an existing run dir (crash
  recovery, budget top-up)
- ✅ Engine-crash consistency tests (kill -9 at nasty moments)
- ✅ Run-dir schema version + migration story
- ✅ `ralphctl llm test` hardening; richer `doctor`
- ✅ Cost/usage accounting surfaced per phase and per approach

## v0.3 — hub UI

- ✅ `ralphctl ui`: local web hub reading `~/.ralphd/runs/*` and proxying live
  container APIs — run list, task progress, iteration timeline, live transcript
  tail, steering form, history browsing
- ✅ Static bundle served by the CLI (no separate server process to manage,
  no npm/node build step)

## v0.4 — quality-of-life

- ✅ Self-reflection phase (post-job analysis proposing prompt/skill improvements as a
  diff in artifacts)
- ✅ Job templates (`ralphctl start --template <name>`) bundling PRD skeleton +
  skills + profile
- ✅ Pluggable notifications on completion (shell hook: `on_complete_cmd`)
- ✅ Multi-workspace jobs (multiple repos mounted side by side)

## v0.5 — session resilience & self-recovery

Full PRD: [`docs/prds/v0.5-resilience.md`](prds/v0.5-resilience.md). Driven by
three live incidents (a DNS wobble destroying 4 of 8 approaches, a lost
post-mortem, an agent deleting its own container) and the GitHub backlog
(#1–#11, #13). Phase 1 is the resilience half and lands first; Phase 2 is
operator surfaces.

Phase 1 — the environment must not be able to destroy a job:

- ✅ In-band LLM errors classified as faults at all — `pi` reports endpoint
  failures with `exit_code: 0`, which `classify_fault()` used to score as
  success, making the whole retry/refund apparatus unreachable in production.
  A non-empty `error_message` is now a fault regardless of exit code, the
  signature table covers the observed gateway/Bedrock families, the bare
  `aborted` error is `infra` only when there was no traffic *and* no operator
  abort, and the verdict is recorded as `faultClass` in each iteration's
  `meta.json` and the `iteration.end` event (#11)
- ✅ Aggressive retry: fast escalating backoff (`2,5,15,30,60,120,300`s, last
  value repeating up to `infra_retry_backoff_max_s`), a wall-clock **outage
  budget** (`infra_outage_budget_s`, default 4h, `ralphctl start
  --infra-outage-budget`) in place of the 3-attempt cap (`infra_retry_max` is
  now honoured only when set explicitly), all five phases covered without
  double-counting phase-local error budgets, waits accounted as
  `infraWaitTotalS` with the job deadline extended by them, plus an explicit
  `health: ok|degraded` / `infraWait` status contract surfaced in
  `ralphctl status` and the hub — while keeping the fail-fast path for a
  broken credential (stable instant no-traffic failures still get the
  broken-environment diagnosis in seconds) (#5, #11)
- ✅ `POST /retry` + `ralphctl retry <run-id>` (+ a hub retry-now button with a
  countdown): the backoff wait is an interruptible event, so an operator who
  knows the endpoint is back skips the remaining wait and resets the
  outage-budget episode clock
- ✅ Reflect phase gets retry (with a pre-attempt wait after an infra-shaped
  ending) *and* reports its own failure — `status.json`'s `reflect` outcome +
  `artifacts/reflection/FAILED.md`, surfaced in `ralphctl status` and the hub —
  instead of silently producing no post-mortem (#5)
- ✅ A run recorded `running` with no container is visible to `repair` (guarded
  `--set-state` writing a vanished-container reason + audit event), `status`
  (explicit warning line, on-disk task counts, staleness instead of a growing
  live elapsed) and the hub's warning treatment — not only to `doctor`, whose
  remedy text now tells the same story (#8)
- ✅ Opt-in self-recovery, shipped **off by default**: `ralphctl start
  --auto-resume` (or the registry default `ralphctl config set auto_resume
  true`) marks a run as opted in, and `ralphctl doctor --fix` — run from cron/
  systemd, no new daemon — resumes exactly those runs recorded non-terminal
  whose container has vanished. Opted-out runs are reported and left alone;
  terminal runs and runs whose termination was operator-initiated (`abort`/
  `stop`) are never resurrected; a crash-loop guard (`autoResume: {attempts,
  lastAt, maxAttempts}` in the run dir) spaces attempts with escalating
  backoff and gives up with a readable reason. The default is a single literal,
  `AUTO_RESUME_DEFAULT` in `src/ralphd/cli/main.py`; **v0.7 (requirement O)
  flipped that literal to ON** now that the guard and the never-resurrect rule
  have been validated on real runs — a dangling unattended run is worth more
  resumed than left sitting until a human notices — so opting a run out is
  `start --no-auto-resume` (or `ralphctl config set auto_resume false`
  registry-wide). What v0.5 itself shipped is the opt-in version above
- ✅ `ralphctl watch` (and `ralphctl logs -f`) stop closing at a *historical*
  terminal-state marker: the stream ends on a terminal event only when it is
  the log's last event *and* the engine is not live, and resume now appends an
  explicit `running` state event so a stale marker can never be the log's
  final word (#13)
- ✅ The documented sibling-cleanup idiom can no longer delete the job
  container: `ralphd.role=job|sibling` labels + `RALPHD_SELF_CONTAINER_ID`,
  the sibling-only cleanup filter propagated to every documented copy
  (prompt, skill example, architecture, CLI docs) with a test that runs the
  documented command and proves the job container survives (#7)
- ✅ Logs readable from disk when the container is gone, on both hub and CLI —
  one shared `log_merge` module behind the live API, the hub's snapshot label
  and `ralphctl logs` (pretty/`--raw`/`--follow`, exit 0 with a stderr
  notice), plus an explicit `(no transcript yet)` for an empty run (#6)

Phase 2 — operator surfaces:

- ✅ In-flight iteration-budget top-up via `PATCH /config/budget` + `ralphctl
  budget <run-id> +N|N`, proven e2e on a job that was about to exhaust its
  budget (#3)
- ✅ Absolute timestamps (one shared formatter, ISO kept in the payload) in the
  iteration timeline, `logs`, and `status` (#4)
- ✅ Unknown cost rendered as unknown instead of `$0.0000` — unpriced
  iterations are marked (`costPriced: false`), run totals mixing priced and
  unpriced read as *partial*, every surface renders unknown/partial as
  unavailable, and an optional host-side pricing map (with gateway aliases)
  can supply a *derived* cost that is never conflated with a
  provider-reported one (#10); `artifacts/reports/pricing-anomaly.md` records
  the investigation of the same-model priced/unpriced anomaly
- ✅ Sortable run list in the hub (all seven columns, sort state outside the
  DOM, newest-first by default), with `ralphctl runs --sort/--reverse` parity (#9)
- ✅ PRD dialog and clickable task detail in the hub (#1, #2)

## v0.6 — first-release polish

Full PRD: [`docs/prds/v0.6-first-release.md`](prds/v0.6-first-release.md).
Driven by the release-hygiene backlog (#14–#22) and by three defects this
project's own runs kept hitting: numbers on screen that were wrong rather than
unknown, a run that could not explain itself without an operator reading the
run dir by hand, and a job image nothing ever built. Requirement letters below
are the PRD's.

Phase 1 — stop printing wrong numbers:

- ✅ **A. A mid-write `tasks.json` is never served as "no tasks" (#15).** One
  hardened read path (`read_tasks_doc`) behind every surface: a bounded re-read
  on a parse failure, then the last successfully parsed payload flagged stale,
  with **absent**, **unparseable** and **parsed-empty** kept apart instead of
  collapsing into one default. The last-good cache is written only on the sad
  path, so it is a fallback for a file being rewritten and never a mirror; the
  stale flag is rendered by `GET /tasks`, `GET /status`, `ralphctl tasks` and
  the hub table, which a browser test drives through an agent-style rewrite to
  prove it does not blink
- ✅ **B. Approach `n/m` on every surface (#16).** `maxApproaches` in
  `status.json` (written at the first status write, so a job that dies in
  startup still has its denominator), one shared `format_approach` renderer in
  `ralphctl status`, `ralphctl runs`, the hub run list and run detail; a
  pre-v0.6 `status.json` renders `2` bare rather than inventing a ceiling, a
  run with no approach yet renders empty, and the column still sorts numerically
- ✅ **C. Derived cost from a built-in AWS Bedrock table, and a model id you can
  see (#14).** A shipped Bedrock rate table with an alias map for the gateway
  forms, a machine-readable as-of date and a staleness signal, reusing
  `PricingMap`'s matching rules; selected by `price_strategy` (LLM profile,
  `ralphctl start --price-strategy`, replayed by `resume`), with an operator
  `pricing:` map still winning and `price_strategy: none` byte-identical to
  v0.5. Derived money stays derived (`costDerivedUSD`), `GET /config` names
  which table answered, and the resolved/raw model ids are recorded per
  iteration and in `status.json` — including the id `pi` chose when the run
  pinned none, which is what makes the derivation fire on an unpinned route.
  An **implausible zero quote** (a quoted `costUSD` of 0 beside hundreds of
  thousands of billed tokens, which is what this project's own gateway sends)
  is now classified as unknown instead of `$0.00`; only a route that declares
  itself free reads as free
- ✅ **D. Task progress in the run list (#21).** A `TASKS` column (`5/7`,
  blank rather than `0/0` for a plan-less run) in the hub and in
  `ralphctl runs`, sorting on the completion fraction with plan-less runs last,
  flagging validation-failed and in-progress in `_summarize_tasks`' own
  wording, from one hardened local read per row and no live proxy call

Phase 2 — make the run explain itself:

- ✅ **E. Steering is readable, not just writable (#17).** `GET /steering` on
  the engine, a hub steering-history panel (pending/applied, body in the single
  dialog) and `ralphctl steer --list` (`--json`), all through one live-first,
  on-disk-fallback reader, so a post-mortem still sees what was sent
- ✅ **F. Click to view details, across the run detail page (#18).** Five new
  dialogs, each with its CLI counterpart: iteration detail
  (`ralphctl iteration`), the run state documents including a redacted
  `job.yaml` (`ralphctl docs`), artifacts and the reflection report
  (`ralphctl artifacts`), the fault explanation (`ralphctl fault`) and the
  per-phase/per-approach cost breakdown (`ralphctl cost`). Text nodes only,
  exactly one dialog alive across a poll, every view answerable from the
  on-disk snapshot with the container gone
- ✅ **G. Deleting a dead run takes one command (#19).** `ralphctl rm --force`
  stops a leftover container and then removes state, while plain `rm` keeps
  refusing and `--force` still refuses a *running* job outright; the hub grows
  a delete affordance for terminal runs only, behind a confirm dialog naming
  the run id and disabled with a reason while a run is active

Phase 3 — the image lifecycle:

- ✅ **H. The job image builds itself, and a job can bring its own (#20).**
  `start`/`resume` hash the image inputs and build `ralphd:<hash>` only on a
  cache miss, so running a stale engine is structurally impossible; a
  user-supplied image is a **base** (`ralphd-base:<hash>`) that ralphd layers
  the engine and `pi` onto (`ralphd-derived:<hash>`); `--dockerfile`,
  `job.yaml` and registry `config.yaml` supply it with the most specific
  winning; the resolved reference is recorded in run state so `resume`
  reproduces the image the run started with rather than the current hash; a
  failed build fails `start` before any run state exists; `doctor` reports
  staleness; and a `pipx`-style install hashes the same inputs shipped as
  package data

Phase 4 — close the loop:

- ✅ **I. Close #14–#22 from inside the run (#14–#22).** The wave's own last
  requirement, done after the final verification sweep passed: it extends
  `artifacts/reports/issue-traceability.md` with an issue → requirement → task
  → commit → tests section per issue, closes each issue over the GitHub REST
  API with a comment naming that evidence, and writes
  `artifacts/reports/issue-closure.md` as the auditable record (issue number,
  status code, resulting state, comment url). Read those two reports for what
  actually closed; an issue that did not fully land is left open and named in
  both
- ✅ **J. Release hygiene and the doc audit (#22).** A deliberate first-release
  version asserted against this roadmap, the dead `cli` extra dropped and every
  remaining requirement tied to the place it is used, every evidence report
  under `artifacts/reports/` re-read by the suite, a documented-but-nonexistent
  CLI flag or API field now failing the suite, and the semantic pass over
  `README.md`, `docs/` and `SPEC.md` — each correction landed with the check
  that would have caught it

## Later / explicitly deferred

- PID-namespace isolation of agent iterations from in-container kill signals
  (a supervisor-level SIGKILL/SIGTERM currently reaches the running `pi`
  subprocess directly since it shares the container's PID namespace; giving
  each iteration its own PID namespace would let the engine distinguish
  "stop this one iteration" from "the whole container is being torn down"
  more cleanly) — noted during task 060's operator escalation, not attempted
  there; rationale: prompt rules alone did not prevent the iteration-103
  pkill incident, so engine-level self-protection is needed, not just
  prompt-level guidance.
- Publishing the Docker image and the wheel. The image builds locally and is
  content-hashed (v0.6 requirement H) — including from a `pipx`-style install,
  whose wheel ships the image inputs as package data — and the docker tier
  proves the built image runs. What is deferred is the *publishing* pipeline:
  nothing pushes a tag to a registry or a wheel to PyPI, so `--image` names a
  locally built tag and there is no `ralphd` to install from an index yet.
- Remote/daemon mode (running ralphd on a server, CLI over the network) — the
  token+bind options already make this *possible*; making it *nice* (TLS, discovery)
  is deferred
- Alternative agent runtimes behind an interface (claude code, codex, opencode) —
  revisit once the pi-only loop is stable
- Parallel jobs orchestration/queueing — out of scope; the CLI's `--json` interface
  is deliberately sufficient for an external orchestrator (human, script, or agent)
- First-class named env-wiring profiles (reusable `--forward-env`/creds bundles
  referenced by name at `start`, analogous to LLM profiles) — operators
  currently repeat the same multi-flag `--forward-env`/`--llm-env`/`--env`
  incantation on every run; the per-run env-wiring persistence added for
  resume (roadmap-4 requirement A) only records what was resolved for *that*
  run, it doesn't let an operator name and reuse a bundle across runs. Worth
  revisiting once there's a second real profile-shaped use case.
