# ralphd Container API

Each job container serves this HTTP API (default `:7777`, published to
`127.0.0.1:<host-port>` by `ralphctl`). Content type is JSON unless noted. When an
API token is configured, every route requires `Authorization: Bearer <token>` and
replies `401` otherwise.

Errors use RFC 7807 problem+json: `{"type", "title", "status", "detail"}`.

## Conventions

- All state-reading endpoints work in every lifecycle state, including `idle` after
  completion — that is the point of idle mode.
- Mutating endpoints that no longer make sense (e.g. steering a `succeeded` job)
  return `409` with an explanatory detail.
- Timestamps are RFC 3339 UTC.

## Status & observation

### `GET /healthz`
Liveness. `200 {"ok": true}` — no auth required (the only unauthenticated route).

### `GET /status`
The one-call summary. Response:

  }
}
```

`usage.byPhase` breaks the same running totals down by iteration phase
(`planning`/`worker`/`verify`/`review`) and `usage.byApproach` by approach
number (as a string key, since JSON object keys are always strings) — both
are accumulated alongside the top-level totals on every iteration, so for
any token/cost field `sum(byPhase[*][field]) == sum(byApproach[*][field])
== usage[field]`. A phase/approach only appears once at least one iteration
for it has ended.

The cost fields carry the same unknown/partial honesty as an individual
iteration's (`GET /iterations` below). A bucket — the top-level total *and*
every `byPhase`/`byApproach` entry — describes how it mixes priced and
unpriced iterations with an optional `costStatus`:

| shape | meaning |
|-------|---------|
| no `costStatus` | every iteration in the bucket was priced by the provider (or billed nothing at all): `costUSD` is the whole cost |
| `costStatus: "partial"` | the bucket mixes reported prices with billed-but-unpriced tokens: `costUSD` is the **priced subtotal**, i.e. a lower bound |
| `costStatus: "unknown"` | tokens were billed and nothing in the bucket was ever priced: there is no `costUSD` (except a literal `0` contributed by no-traffic iterations) and no meaningful cost figure |
| `costStatus: "derived"` | nothing is unknown, but part of the money came from the host-side pricing map rather than the provider: `costDerivedUSD` holds that part (see below) |

`costStatus` is monotone: once a bucket contains unpriced traffic it can never
go back to fully known, and a later priced iteration only upgrades `unknown` to
`partial`. The `sum(byPhase[*][field]) == usage[field]` invariant still holds
for every field including `costUSD`, but when a bucket is `partial`/`unknown`
that sum is a sum of priced subtotals, not of costs — which is exactly why the
marker exists rather than a silent subset total. Renderers must show
`partial`/`unknown` cost as unavailable instead of `$0.0000` — every shipped
surface (`ralphctl status`, the `ralphctl logs` iteration footer, the hub's
usage panel, the `watch` cost gauge) does so through the single formatter
`engine/state.format_cost`, which renders `unknown` as `unavailable` and
`partial` as `$<priced subtotal>+ (partial, rest unavailable)`. The hub gets
that string server-side as `usage.costDisplay` (plus `costDisplay` on each
`byPhase`/`byApproach` bucket) alongside the untouched raw fields.

#### Derived cost (optional host-side pricing map)

When a `pricing:` map is configured (see `docs/cli.md`, and the resolved rates
in `GET /config`), a bucket or iteration whose tokens the provider quoted **no**
price for also carries `costDerivedUSD`: USD computed from that map's
per-million rates. It is a separate field on purpose — it is never added into
`costUSD`, so `costUSD` always means "money the provider itself quoted" and no
consumer can silently mix the two. `format_cost` renders derived money with a
`~` and the word `derived` (`~$0.45 derived`, or `$0.56 + ~$0.45 derived` when
both kinds are present, or `$0.56 + ~$0.45 derived, partial (rest unavailable)`
when part of the cost is still unknown). With no map configured nothing
changes: an unpriced bucket stays `unknown`.

`deadlineAt` is `startedAt + jobTimeoutS` **plus every second this run has
spent waiting out an infra outage** (`infraWaitTotalS`, the cumulative infra
backoff wait — see the infra budgets under `GET /config`). Waiting for a
broken LLM endpoint is not work the job's timeout should pay for: each backoff
wait extends the deadline by exactly the waited time and emits a
`deadline_extended` event, so `jobTimeoutS` keeps its plain meaning (time
available to the agent) and a 4-hour gateway outage cannot silently consume
half an 8-hour job. `infraWaitTotalS` is `0` for a run that never hit an
outage and survives `ralphctl resume` (the per-process deadline does not).

#### `health` and `infraWait`

`state` stays `starting|running|succeeded|failed|aborted` — there is **no**
`degraded` state value, because that would break every consumer's
terminal-state logic (`ralphctl watch` included). A run that is sitting out an
infra outage says so with two dedicated fields instead:

| field | meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `health` | `"ok"` normally; `"degraded"` from the first infra-classified failure of an outage episode until an iteration reaches the model again (or the run ends on the outage) |
| `infraWait` | `null` whenever the run is not actually in a backoff wait; otherwise the object below |

```json
"health": "degraded",
"infraWait": {
  "since": "2026-08-18T09:14:02Z", "attempt": 4,
  "error": "getaddrinfo EAI_AGAIN aigw…", "phase": "worker",
  "nextAttemptAt": "2026-08-18T09:15:02Z",
  "waitedS": 52, "budgetS": 14400, "remainingS": 14348
}
```

`waitedS`/`budgetS`/`remainingS` are this episode's cumulative backoff wait,
the `infraOutageBudgetS` it is spent against, and what is left of it (see the
infra budgets under `GET /config`). `infraWait` goes back to `null` when the
wait ends and the next attempt starts, while `health` stays `"degraded"` until
an iteration actually reaches the model — a run between two backoffs has not
recovered yet. Both are also emitted as events (`infra_wait` /
`infra_recovered`), so the whole episode is visible in the event stream
`ralphctl watch` follows and not only to a client polling `/status` at the
right moment. Surfaced by `ralphctl status`'s `degraded:` line and the hub
run-detail card. A wait can be cut short with `POST /retry`. The whole model
(fault taxonomy, outage budget, deadline extension, retry-now, the
instant-failure fail-fast carve-out) is described in `docs/architecture.md`
§10 “Resilience: transient endpoint outages”.

#### `reflect`

Absent from `status.json` (and `null` in `GET /status`) unless the run was
started with `reflect: true` and the post-terminal reflect iteration has
finished. Then:

```json
"reflect": {"ok": false, "error": "Connection error.",
            "endedAt": "2026-08-18T09:31:20Z"}
```

`ok: true` means `artifacts/reflection/report.md` exists; otherwise `error`
carries the agent's error text (or `the reflect iteration wrote no
artifacts/reflection/report.md` when it exited cleanly having written
nothing) and `artifacts/reflection/FAILED.md` names the same error on disk.
A failed reflection **never** changes the run's `state`, `verdict` or
`reason` — the job is already over when reflect runs. Surfaced by
`ralphctl status` and the hub run-detail card, and emitted as a
`reflect_done` event.

### `GET /tasks`
Full `tasks.json`.

### `GET /prd`
`text/markdown` — the PRD in effect (composite PRD when approach ≥ 2).
`GET /prd?original=true` returns the original regardless. `404` when the run
dir holds no PRD at all. Which file that is (`composite-prd.md` when present,
else `prd.md`) is decided by one shared helper,
`ralphd.engine.state.prd_path`, which the hub's host-side on-disk fallback
(`GET /api/runs/<id>/prd`, behind the run-detail **view PRD** dialog — see
docs/cli.md) uses too, so a live and an on-disk read of the same run dir can
never disagree about which text is "the PRD".

### `GET /notes`
`text/markdown` — current `notes.md` handoff notes.

### `GET /iterations`
Array of every iteration's `meta.json` (number, phase, approach, model, timestamps,
exit code, sentinel seen, token usage, steering consumed).

Each finished iteration also carries `faultClass` — the engine's own fault verdict
for that iteration (`src/ralphd/engine/faults.py:classify_fault`), the same verdict
the infra-retry wrapper acts on:

| `faultClass` | meaning |
|--------------|---------|
| `null` | not a failure: clean exit, no error recorded, not interrupted/timed out |
| `"infra"` | the LLM endpoint/provider/network broke (no traffic within the startup window, or a recognized infra error signature) — the attempt is retried and refunded, never charged to the iteration budget |
| `"work"` | the agent really ran (LLM traffic observed) and then failed, or an operator-initiated abort/interrupt ended it — never retried as an outage |

The field is absent only while an iteration is still in flight (before its
`endedAt` is written). The signature families behind `"infra"`, and the
`aborted`/operator-abort carve-out, are documented in
`docs/architecture.md` §10.1.

An iteration's `usage` records cost only when the provider actually quoted a
price. `usage.costPriced` is the marker:

| shape | meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `costUSD: 0.42`, `costPriced: true` | provider-reported price (an explicit `0.0` means free) |
| no `costUSD`, `costPriced: false` | tokens were billed and **no** price was reported — cost is *unknown*, not $0 |
| `costUSD` present, `costPriced: false` | mixed: the value is the priced subtotal only, so treat it as partial |
| `costUSD: 0`, no `costPriced` | nothing was billed at all (e.g. pi's zero-filled `usage` on an in-band error) |
| `costDerivedUSD: 0.31`, `costDerived: true` | every unpriced message was covered by the host-side pricing map — cost is *derived*, and kept out of `costUSD` |
| `costDerived: false` | at least one unpriced message had no rate in the map (or no map is configured), so part of the cost stays unknown |

How a run total / `byPhase` / `byApproach` bucket summarises a mix of priced and
unpriced iterations is the `costStatus` contract under `GET /status` above.

### `GET /iterations/{n}`
One iteration's `meta.json`.

### `GET /iterations/{n}/output`
`application/x-ndjson` — the full agent transcript for iteration *n*. Supports
`?tail=<lines>`. For the in-flight iteration, `?follow=true` streams new lines until
the iteration ends (chunked).

### `GET /logs`
`application/x-ndjson` — the **whole-job log**: every iteration's transcript
merged in order, with a synthetic boundary line injected between iterations:

```json
{"type":"ralphd.iteration","number":7,"phase":"worker","event":"start",
 "model":"...","approach":1}
```

(and a matching `"event":"end"` line carrying exit code, sentinels, error, usage).
All other lines are pi transcript lines passed through as-is, except that any
known secret value (LLM env vars, placed creds file values) is mechanically
scrubbed and replaced with `[REDACTED:<source>]` as a defense-in-depth layer
on top of the same scrubbing already applied when `output.jsonl`/`events.jsonl`
were written (see `docs/architecture.md`'s "Security: mechanical secret
redaction" section).

Query params: `?tail=<lines>` bounds the initial backlog (counted over transcript
lines, boundaries not counted); `?follow=true` keeps streaming **across iteration
boundaries** until the job reaches a terminal state (then closes). `tail` and
`follow` combine (tail backlog, then live). This endpoint serves raw NDJSON only —
pretty rendering is `ralphctl logs`' job.

### `GET /events`
`text/event-stream` (SSE). Replays from `?since=<eventId>` (default: live only),
then follows. Event types:

| type | payload highlights |
|------|--------------------|
| `state` | lifecycle transition: `state` is `running` (emitted by every engine process as it starts the job loop, resume included) or the terminal `succeeded`/`failed`/`aborted`; the startup event also carries `resumed` (`true` when this process picked up a run dir that already held recorded work) |
| `phase` | phase entered (planning/worker/verify/review), approach number |
| `iteration.start` / `iteration.end` | number, phase, model / exit, sentinel, error, `faultClass` (`null` \| `"infra"` \| `"work"`, identical to the iteration's `meta.json` — see `GET /iterations`) |
| `task` | task id + old/new status — emitted live while a worker iteration is still running (polled every ~0.25s against `tasks.json`), not only after the iteration ends, so `pending -> in-progress` is observable in real time |
| `steering.received` / `steering.consumed` | steering file name |
| `signal` | COMPLETE / VERIFIED / task-verified detected |
| `log` | engine-level notices (timeouts, retries, failures) |
| `infra_retry` | an infra-classified attempt is being retried: phase, attempt, error, `backoffS` (`null` when giving up), `waitedS`, `budgetS` |
| `infra_wait` | a backoff wait started: the full `infraWait` payload (`since`, `attempt`, `error`, `phase`, `nextAttemptAt`, `waitedS`, `budgetS`, `remainingS`) plus `backoffS`; the run is now `health: "degraded"` |
| `infra_recovered` | an iteration reached the model again: `health: "ok"`, `infraWaitTotalS` — the outage episode is over and `infraWait` is back to `null` |
| `infra_retry_now` | an operator woke a backoff wait via `POST /retry`: phase, attempt, error, `source: "operator"` |
| `reflect_infra_delay` | the job ended on an infra-shaped failure, so the post-terminal `reflect` iteration waits before its first attempt instead of firing into the same dead endpoint: `delayS`, `error`, `budgetS` (reflect's own, capped, outage budget). Followed by an ordinary `infra_wait` with `attempt: 0` |
| `reflect_done` | the post-terminal `reflect` iteration finished: `ok`, plus `error` when it failed (same verdict as status.json's `reflect`) |
| `deadline_extended` | the job deadline moved out after an infra wait: phase, attempt, `waitedS`, `infraWaitTotalS`, new `deadlineAt`, `reason` |
| `budget_changed` | the iteration budget was changed in flight via `PATCH /config/budget`: `field: "iterations"`, `previous`, `iterations` (new value), `delta`, `iterationsUsed`, `source: "api"` |

Every event also lands in `events.jsonl` in the run dir with a monotonically
increasing `id`. That file is append-only **across resumes**, so a terminal
`state` event can sit in the middle of the log — the `running` state event a
resuming engine emits supersedes it, which is what lets a follower tell a
historical marker from the run's real terminus (see `ralphctl watch` in
[cli.md](cli.md)).

### `GET /artifacts` and `GET /artifacts/{path}`
List (recursive, with sizes) and download files from the artifacts dir.

## Steering & control

### `POST /steering`
Body: `{"message": "<markdown>", "name": "optional-slug"}`. Writes the next
`NNN-<slug>.md` into the steering inbox. Consumed at the next iteration start.
`202 {"file": "003-optional-slug.md"}`.

### `GET /steering`
Lists steering files with `consumed` flags and the iteration that consumed them.

### `POST /interrupt`
SIGINTs the current agent process (the iteration ends as `interrupted`; the loop
proceeds to the next iteration immediately, picking up any pending steering).
No-op `409` if no iteration is running. Body optional:
`{"message": "..."}` — convenience combo, equivalent to `POST /steering` then
interrupt.

### `POST /pause` / `POST /resume`
Pause finishes the current iteration, then holds before the next one
(`state: running`, `phase: paused` reported in `/status`). Resume releases it.

### `POST /retry`
Wakes an infra backoff wait immediately instead of waiting for
`infraWait.nextAttemptAt`: the failed phase/iteration is retried at once and
the outage-budget **episode clock is reset** (the cumulative `waitedS` starts
from zero again, while the attempt counter — and therefore the escalating
backoff — is kept). Emits `infra_retry_now`. `200 {"retrying": true}`.
CLI: `ralphctl retry <run-id>` (docs/cli.md). Hub: the "retry now" button on
a degraded run-detail card, via the hub's `POST /api/runs/<id>/retry` proxy
(docs/cli.md's `ralphctl ui` section).

`409` when the run is not actually in an infra wait (`health: "ok"` /
`infraWait: null`, or the job already finished) — the problem detail says so.
Naming: `/retry` is about a **degraded** run waiting out an endpoint outage;
`/resume` is about a **paused** run waiting for the operator. They are
independent — `/retry` never unpauses a paused run and never touches steering,
`/resume` never shortens a backoff. Design notes: `docs/architecture.md`
§10.4.

### `POST /abort`
Body: `{"reason": "..."}`. Interrupts the current iteration and terminates the job
as `aborted` (honors `onComplete` — idles or exits).

### `POST /shutdown`
Only valid when the job is finished (`succeeded|failed|aborted`); exits the
container. `409` while running — use `/abort` first.

## Runtime configuration

### `GET /config`
Effective job config (redacted — no secret values, no credential file
contents, no LLM env values):

```json
{
  "runId": "...",
  "budgets": {"iterations": 25, "maxApproaches": 3, "jobTimeoutS": 28800, "iterationTimeoutS": 2700,
              "infraStartupTimeoutS": 150.0, "infraRetryBackoffS": [2, 5, 15, 30, 60, 120, 300],
              "infraRetryBackoffMaxS": 300.0, "infraRetryMax": null, "infraOutageBudgetS": 14400.0},
  "flags": {"vigilant": false, "onComplete": "idle"},
  "model": {"strategy": "quality-first", "model": null, "fastModel": null, "overrides": {}, "thinking": null},
  "pricing": null,                 // or the resolved host-side rate table, see below
  "prompts": [{"name": "planning", "source": "builtin"}, ...],
  "skills": [{"name": "...", "origin": "mounted"}, ...],
  "creds": ["github", ...],
  "llmEnvKeys": ["..."]
}
```

The infra-fault (LLM endpoint/network outage) budgets, all settable in
`job.yaml` and via env:

| Field | `job.yaml` key / env | Default | Meaning |
|-------|----------------------|---------|---------|
| `infraStartupTimeoutS` | `infra_startup_timeout_s` / `RALPHD_INFRA_STARTUP_TIMEOUT` | `150.0` | how long an iteration may run with zero observed LLM traffic before it is killed as an infra fault |
| `infraRetryBackoffS` | `infra_retry_backoff_s` / `RALPHD_INFRA_RETRY_BACKOFF_S` (`"s1,s2,..."`) | `[2, 5, 15, 30, 60, 120, 300]` | escalating wait between retries of the same phase/iteration; the last value repeats for further attempts |
| `infraRetryBackoffMaxS` | `infra_retry_backoff_max_s` / `RALPHD_INFRA_RETRY_BACKOFF_MAX_S` | `300.0` | cap on a single backoff wait (clamps the repeating tail) |
| `infraRetryMax` | `infra_retry_max` / `RALPHD_INFRA_RETRY_MAX` | `null` | optional attempt cap, **honoured only when set explicitly**; `null` means no cap — retry for as long as the outage budget allows |
| `infraOutageBudgetS` | `infra_outage_budget_s` / `RALPHD_INFRA_OUTAGE_BUDGET_S` | `14400.0` (4h) | wall-clock budget for one fault episode: retries continue while the cumulative wait stays under it; the episode resets on any successful iteration. The post-terminal `reflect` iteration gets `min(this, 300s)` — the job is already over, so a still-dead endpoint must not hold the container open for hours (a `reflect_infra_delay` event covers the wait before its first attempt) |

`creds` lists credential *names* only (no values, no sizes here — see
`GET /config/creds` for that); `llmEnvKeys` lists the *names* of any env
overrides set via `PUT /config/llm`, never their values.

`pricing` is the optional host-side rate table (`pricing` in `job.yaml` /
`RALPHD_PRICING` as JSON, normally inlined from `<registry>/config.yaml` by
`ralphctl start` — see `docs/cli.md`), reported as resolved so an operator can
see which rates produced a derived cost:

```json
{"models": {"openai/gpt-5": {"input": 1.25, "output": 10.0, "cacheRead": 0.125, "cacheWrite": 1.25}},
 "aliases": {"aigw-openai/*": "openai/*"}}
```

Rates are USD per **million** tokens keyed like the usage counters; an absent
cache rate falls back to the `input` rate (never to a silent `$0`). Aliases map
gateway-local model ids onto canonical ones (`"aigw-openai/*": "openai/*"`
keeps the tail). The default is `null` — no map, and unpriced traffic then stays
`unknown` rather than being guessed at. A configured map is consulted **only**
when the provider quoted no price, and its output is published separately as
`costDerivedUSD` (see the usage contract above).

### `PATCH /config/budget`
Raises (or lowers) the **iteration budget of a running job** without restarting
the container. Body:

```json
{"iterations": "+10"}   // relative top-up: current budget + 10
{"iterations": 40}      // absolute new budget
```

Same two forms as `ralphctl resume --iterations` (`"+N"` relative, a bare
integer absolute — so a bare `-5` is an *absolute* -5 and is rejected, never a
decrement; lower a budget by passing the absolute value you want).
`200 {"iterations": 40, "previous": 25, "iterationsUsed": 17}`.

The new value is live at the next iteration boundary (the loop re-reads it on
every turn — a job parked at `iterationsUsed == iterationsBudget` keeps going
after a top-up) and is immediately visible in `GET /status`
(`iterationsBudget`) and `GET /config` (`budgets.iterations`). Every accepted
change emits a `budget_changed` audit event.

Rejections carry a problem detail and change nothing:

| Status | When |
|--------|------|
| `422 iterations required` | no body, or no `iterations` key |
| `422 invalid iterations` | not an integer or `"+N"` string (`"abc"`, `12.5`, `[10]`), an absolute value below `1`, or a negative relative top-up |
| `409 budget below iterations used` | the resulting budget is below `status.iterationsUsed` (the *charged* count — infra-refunded retries are not charged); setting it *equal* is allowed and simply stops the run at the current boundary |
| `409 job finished` | terminal run — bump the budget with `ralphctl resume <run-id> --iterations +N`, which starts a fresh container over the run dir |

This is a change to the **live engine only**: `/config` is a read-only mount, so
the engine never rewrites `job.yaml`. A resumed container reads `job.yaml`
again, so use `resume --iterations +N` when the new budget has to survive a
restart.

### Prompts — override + listing

| Method & path | Body / response |
|---------------|-----------------|
| `GET /config/prompts` | list: `{"name": ..., "source": ...}` for every phase (`planning`, `worker`, `review`, `task-verify`); `source` is `builtin` / `mounted` (`/config/prompts/{name}.md`) / `api` (after a `PUT`) |
| `PUT /config/prompts/{name}` | `text/markdown` body. Replaces a phase prompt override; `name` must be one of the four phase names above, else `422`; `204` on success. Effective next iteration that builds this phase's prompt. |

### Skills — full CRUD

| Method & path | Body / response |
|---------------|-----------------|
| `GET /config/skills` | list: name, origin (`mounted` / `api`), file count |
| `GET /config/skills/{name}` | `application/x-tar` — the skill directory |
| `PUT /config/skills/{name}` | `application/x-tar` — a skill directory (must contain `SKILL.md`); unpacked, visible next iteration; `204` |
| `DELETE /config/skills/{name}` | removes the skill (mounted or api-added); `204`, `404` if absent |

### Credentials — full CRUD (env-file convention)

Credential files follow the env-file convention (see architecture §5): each
`{name}.env` is `KEY=value` lines placed at `~/.creds/{name}.env` (0600) inside
the container; prompts tell the agent to source the file it needs. **Read-back is
allowed by design**: the API bearer token is defined as equivalent to holding the
job's credentials — protect the token, not individual routes.

| Method & path | Body / response |
|---------------|-----------------|
| `GET /config/creds` | list: name, size, mtime — no values |
| `GET /config/creds/{name}` | `text/plain` — the env file contents |
| `PUT /config/creds/{name}` | `text/plain` env-file body → `~/.creds/{name}.env` (0600); recognized extras (`gitconfig`, `netrc`, `ssh/`) get conventional re-placement; `204` |
| `DELETE /config/creds/{name}` | removes the file from `~/.creds/`; `204` |

Changes to skills and creds take effect at the next iteration (prompts embed the
current inventory at iteration start). Credential values never appear in
`/run`, events, or engine logs.

### `PUT /config/llm`
Body: `{"env": {"KEY": "value", ...}, "pi": { ...models.json fragment... }}`.
Replaces the LLM endpoint configuration; the engine re-merges pi settings and
applies env to subsequent iterations. Used by `ralphctl llm set` for mid-run
endpoint/key rotation. `204`.

## Versioning

`GET /version` → `{"ralphd": "0.1.0", "api": 1, "pi": "<pi version>"}`. Breaking
API changes bump `api`; `ralphctl` checks compatibility on connect.
