# PRDs

The PRD is the artifact `ralphctl start --prd <file>` consumes: the job's brief,
its standing rules, and its definition of done. This directory keeps the ones
ralphd was built with, so the reasoning behind a wave of work survives the run
that executed it.

Every file here is the **verbatim** input, byte-identical to
`~/.ralphd/runs/<run-id>/prd.md` (and to `~/.ralphd/configs/<run-id>/prd.md`,
which is what a `resume` re-reads). The five `selfdev-*.md` files were recovered
from that storage after the fact — the earlier waves were never committed.

| Run | File | Outcome | Iterations | Tokens | Cost |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `selfdev-vigilant-4` | [selfdev-vigilant-4.md](selfdev-vigilant-4.md) | succeeded / verified | 13 | 2.1M | $3.39 |
| `selfdev-roadmap-1` | [selfdev-roadmap-1.md](selfdev-roadmap-1.md) | **aborted** / unverified | 1 | 1.2M | $2.22 |
| `selfdev-roadmap-2` | [selfdev-roadmap-2.md](selfdev-roadmap-2.md) | succeeded / verified | 148 | 219.3M | $91.66 |
| `selfdev-roadmap-3` | [selfdev-roadmap-3.md](selfdev-roadmap-3.md) | succeeded / verified | 41 | 43.7M | $21.07 |
| `selfdev-roadmap-4` | [selfdev-roadmap-4.md](selfdev-roadmap-4.md) | succeeded / verified | 43 | 27.6M | $17.35 |
| `selfdev-v05-resilience` | [v0.5-resilience.md](v0.5-resilience.md) | succeeded / verified | 132 | 163.9M | unpriced route |
| `selfdev-v06-release` | [v0.6-first-release.md](v0.6-first-release.md) | still running / 54 of 55 tasks verified, 1 failed | 143+ | 310.2M+ | unavailable |

Notes worth keeping with the documents:

- **`selfdev-roadmap-1` and `-2` are the same brief, twice.** The first attempt
  died 50 seconds in: the job's own verifier ran `pkill -f ralphd-engine` and
  SIGTERM'd the engine driving it. `selfdev-roadmap-2` is that PRD plus the
  engine-self-protection task (`ralphd-engine` argument parsing with no side
  effects, an exclusive `flock` on the run dir) and the "you are running INSIDE
  a ralphd engine" prohibitions. Diffing the two is the cheapest way to see what
  one self-inflicted kill taught the project.
- **`v0.5-resilience.md` reports no cost** because the run went out over a
  gateway route whose model ids the provider never priced — the bug that run
  fixed (issue #10): unknown cost is no longer collapsed into `$0.0000`. The fix
  is not retroactive, so this run's own numbers stay zero.
- **`v0.6-first-release.md`'s row is the run's own snapshot of itself**, read
  from that run's `status.json` by the iteration that wrote the row, which is
  why its counts carry a `+`: the run was still running, and a run cannot
  count the iterations that document and verify it. The outcome, honestly:
  every issue in the brief (#14–#22) is closed on GitHub with a closing comment
  (`artifacts/reports/issue-closure.md`), 54 of the 55 planned tasks are
  completed, and one — a whole-SPEC rewrite — is recorded `failed` after three
  validation attempts, its scope having landed in three narrower commits
  instead. The cost is `unavailable` rather than unpriced-and-silent: the
  gateway quoted `costUSD: 0` with `costPriced: true` beside 310M billed
  tokens, and the work in this very wave (issue #14) classifies that
  implausible zero as unknown on read instead of rendering `$0.00`. Feeding the
  same recorded counters through the built-in AWS Bedrock table this wave
  shipped (`ralphctl start --price-strategy aws`) derives ≈ $350 — an estimate,
  and a floor. Full evidence in `artifacts/reports/issue-traceability.md`.
- Some run dirs also hold a `composite-prd.md`. That one is **engine-generated**
  (the PRD with approach history appended for later approaches), not an authored
  input, so it is not kept here.
