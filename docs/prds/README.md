# PRDs

The PRD is the artifact `ralphctl start --prd <file>` consumes: the job's brief,
its standing rules, and its definition of done. This directory keeps the ones
ralphd was built with, so the reasoning behind a wave of work survives the run
that executed it.

Every file here for a wave that has **run** is the verbatim input, byte-identical
to `~/.ralphd/runs/<run-id>/prd.md` (and to `~/.ralphd/configs/<run-id>/prd.md`,
which is what a `resume` re-reads). The five `selfdev-*.md` files were recovered
from that storage after the fact — the earlier waves were never committed. A row
whose outcome reads `not started` is the other direction: the brief is committed
first and there is no run dir to be byte-identical to yet, so the run id names
the launch it is written for, not a run that exists.

| Run | File | Outcome | Iterations | Tokens | Cost |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `selfdev-vigilant-4` | [selfdev-vigilant-4.md](selfdev-vigilant-4.md) | succeeded / verified | 13 | 2.1M | $3.39 |
| `selfdev-roadmap-1` | [selfdev-roadmap-1.md](selfdev-roadmap-1.md) | **aborted** / unverified | 1 | 1.2M | $2.22 |
| `selfdev-roadmap-2` | [selfdev-roadmap-2.md](selfdev-roadmap-2.md) | succeeded / verified | 148 | 219.3M | $91.66 |
| `selfdev-roadmap-3` | [selfdev-roadmap-3.md](selfdev-roadmap-3.md) | succeeded / verified | 41 | 43.7M | $21.07 |
| `selfdev-roadmap-4` | [selfdev-roadmap-4.md](selfdev-roadmap-4.md) | succeeded / verified | 43 | 27.6M | $17.35 |
| `selfdev-v05-resilience` | [v0.5-resilience.md](v0.5-resilience.md) | succeeded / verified | 132 | 163.9M | unpriced route |
| `selfdev-v06-release` | [v0.6-first-release.md](v0.6-first-release.md) | succeeded / verified — 54 of 55 tasks completed, 1 skipped | 145 | 332.1M | unavailable |
| `selfdev-v07-unattended` | [v0.7-trustworthy-unattended.md](v0.7-trustworthy-unattended.md) | not started | — | — | — |

Notes worth keeping with the documents:

- **`selfdev-roadmap-1` and `-2` are the same brief, twice.** The first attempt
  died 50 seconds in: the job's own verifier ran `pkill -f ralphd-engine` and
  SIGTERM'd the engine driving it. `selfdev-roadmap-2` is that PRD plus the
  engine-self-protection task (`ralphd-engine` argument parsing with no side
  effects, an exclusive `flock` on the run dir) and the "you are running INSIDE
  a ralphd engine" prohibitions. Diffing the two is the cheapest way to see what
  one self-inflicted kill taught the project.
- **`v0.5-resilience.md` reports no cost** because the run went out over a
  gateway route whose model ids the provider never priced — the bug that run
  fixed (issue #10): unknown cost is no longer collapsed into `$0.0000`. The fix
  is not retroactive, so this run's own numbers stay zero.
- **`v0.6-first-release.md`'s row is that run's final record**, read from its
  `status.json` after it ended: `state: succeeded`, `verdict: verified` (the
  review passed at raw iteration 154), on approach 1 of a possible 10 — it
  never replanned. The iteration cell is the 145 the engine counted against a
  300 budget, not the 155 raw iteration slots the log holds: the 10-slot
  difference is attempts classified as infrastructure faults, which are retried
  and refunded rather than charged to the budget (`iterationsUsed`, task 001a).
  **That 145 is itself inflated**, by the defect issue #32 names: the refund
  counters lived only in the engine process, so each of that run's resumes
  restarted them at zero and re-charged what had already been credited. 27 of
  its iterations faulted on infrastructure and only 10 refunds survived, so the
  guarantee implies 128 charged, not 145. v0.7 fixes the mechanism (the counters
  are persisted as `status.json`'s `iterationsRefunded` and seeded back on
  resume) but not this row: the cell faithfully reports what the engine wrote,
  and rewriting it would hide the defect instead of recording it.
  The outcome, honestly: every issue in the brief (#14–#22) is closed on GitHub
  with a closing comment (`artifacts/reports/issue-closure.md`),
  54 of the 55 planned tasks are `completed`, and one — `043d`, a whole-SPEC
  rewrite — is recorded `skipped` with all three validation attempts consumed
  (`validationAttempts: 3`, left in place as the record). `skipped` is **not** a
  claim that it met its criteria: it did not. It was relabelled from `failed` by
  operator instruction so the run could leave its task loop and reach the review
  phase, and the scope it was meant to cover shipped in three narrower commits
  instead (`b923af2`, `168a041`, `cc8c8a2`). The cost is `unavailable` rather
  than unpriced-and-silent: the gateway quoted `costUSD: 0` beside 332M billed
  tokens, and the work in this very wave (issue #14) classifies that implausible
  zero as unknown on read instead of rendering `$0.00`. Feeding the same
  recorded counters through the built-in AWS Bedrock table this wave shipped
  (`ralphctl start --price-strategy aws`) derives ≈ $374 — an estimate at that
  table's rates, not money any provider quoted. Full evidence in
  `artifacts/reports/issue-traceability.md`.
- **`v0.7-trustworthy-unattended.md` has not run yet.** It is committed ahead of
  its launch so the brief is reviewable — and because `--prd` reads a file, a
  committed one is the reproducible input. Its `not started` row exists because
  this index requires every PRD in the directory to have exactly one, so the row
  is filled in when the run ends rather than invented now. It carries a caveat
  about the iteration cell above: v0.6's `145` is what the engine recorded, and
  issue #32 (which that wave's PRD asks to fix) means the true charged figure was
  lower — 27 iterations faulted on infrastructure and only 10 refunds survived
  the run's resumes. The row is not being corrected: it faithfully reports what
  was written, and rewriting it would hide the defect instead of fixing it.
- Some run dirs also hold a `composite-prd.md`. That one is **engine-generated**
  (the PRD with approach history appended for later approaches), not an authored
  input, so it is not kept here.
